# Run Detox.
#
# Notes:
# 1) This script was originally designed to work with the wix Detox 
#    sample app located in the main repo here: http://www.github.com/wix/detox. 
#
# 2) Currently there are issues suppresing UI's when executing
#    `brew tap` commands so we chose to install applesimutils
#    from source instead.
#
# 3) Your Node version and Detox build command might be slightly different.
#
# 4) If you're using yarn, make sure to use it instead of npm, to avoid clashes in dependencies
